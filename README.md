Assignment for image processing

Using the Mat class causes quite some overhead because OpenCV offers a lot more functionality and different types than we need. Playing around with loops and type casts can get you a better idea of what values you are dealing with.

###Program
The program can be found in the 'Release' directory. It was mandatory to deliver a Windows executable. The GetARealOS.exe is Windows 8.1 64 bit executable, in order to run correctly you need the Visual c++ 2012 redistributable, which can be downloaded here:

###Documents
We made an user manual and an supporting document which describes the different programmed pipelines.
They can be found in the 'Documents' directory.
