Practical assignment for image processing

This repository is part of the practical assignment application. We made different pipelines for segmenting different images. For a quick start we used OpenCV for reading and displaying the images. All the image processing is done by handmade code.

###Program
The program can be found in the 'Release' directory. It is programmed in C++ and compiled with
Visual C++ 11. It was mandatory to deliver a Windows executable. The GetARealOS.exe is Windows 8.1 64 bit executable, in order to run correctly you need the Visual c++ 2012 redistributable, which can be downloaded here:

The application we have developed is commandline operated only. 
The program can be started by executing the .exe file from a command prompt in Windows. The
repository comes with an 'images' directory. In order to process an image there are five different
pipelines to get the different images segmented well. Look in the user manual for more information.

###Documents
We made an user manual and an supporting document which describes the different programmed pipelines.
They can be found in the 'Documents' directory.
