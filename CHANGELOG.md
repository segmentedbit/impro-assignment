added 'display pixels' and 'greyscale' in statistics.cc also added the 'main()' to test it.

added more functionality: thresholding, inverse, histogram, add, substract.<br>
added an auto-zoom thing (very ugly) for auto-scaling the histogram matrix output.<br>
Removed auto-zoom, final histogram adjustments, works fine now.
